# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 12, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Frontendmentor.io project. Laid down most of the HTML and CSS, including grid display. Tomorrow, I just need to clean up the layout, and add images.  

**Thoughts:** A pretty simple project, I think. I spent most of my time trying to get the layout just right.

### Day 2: January 13, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my first Frontendmentor.io project. However, didn't pick up a second project on account of work and running a fever. Will publish and continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** SICK DAY.

### Day 3: January 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Frontendmentor.io project. Finished pretty quicky, so I took some time to play around with pure CSS images. My first being a [Koala Bear](https://codepen.io/gtmaster2022/pen/Jjrezxw).

**Thoughts:** I was surprised how easily everything came together. Time to start finding more javascript heavy projects.

### Day 4: January 15, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Frontendmentor.io project, with some JS. This one is a little trickier as 1) it contains an accordian FAQ (hi JS), and 2) some of the image floats outside of the container. (Yay to my sudden interest in pure CSS images/graphics). 

**Thoughts:** So far, the setup is going pretty well, and I have an idea of how the JS is going to shake out, but we'll see how it goes when I pick it back up tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 16, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with the desktop layout for the accordion. Took a while how to do an accordion-panel with a CSS only layout. 

**Thoughts:** I looked at the code for Javascript, and understand it, but I'm not at the point yet where I can just code it.
