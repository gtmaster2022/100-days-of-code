# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Restarting this as I got off track with the move to a new city. As such, I'm going to do Javascript30's 30 day challenge, starting with the Javascript Drum Kit. I also reused an old portfolio site idea to display my 100 day coding projects, so I spent about an hour or so cleaning it up and adding my new projects.

**Thoughts:** Learned some new concepts, such as data attributes, but I realized that I need to up my knowledge of Javascript before I dive deeper. As such, I'm studying through freeCodeCamp, and will be starting with some more basic HTML/CSS projects then return to the Javascript Drum Kit. My intention is not to copy + paste, but to make it my own.

**Tools Used**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, forEach

### Day 2: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cert to go over basic HTML and CSS, and then started working on the first project, a responsive tribute page to Bessie Coleman. It took a few hours, because once I started, I couldn't quit until the page was done, and I'm proud of it in spite of, or maybe because of, it's simplicity. 

**Thoughts:** There a little CSS nuggets that I did not know previously such as animations, and while I'm sufficient with CSS grid, I have yet to do anything in Flexbox so the 5 projects tied to this "certification" will give me a chance to utilize flexbox, which is how I learn. For the first project, however, the layout is extremely simple, so as recommended, I coded it in codepen, and played around with the parallax scrolling affect.

**Tools Used**: HTML, CSS, responsive design, responsive image, before/after selectors

### Day 3: January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the second project from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cert - the goal to create a responsive web form. So, I created one for Aesop's Zoo, and got all of the tests passing. Tomorrow, I will just clean up the layout a little as I feel the spacing is off somewhat, especially after grouping the checkboxes and radio buttons in fieldsets. 

**Thoughts:** Not too bad. Thought about using flex for the layout, but pretty much stuck to block/inline displays.

### Day 4: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Took the day off yesterday, and today I am going through a JavaScript basics tutorial whilst building a Tetris game via Ania Kubow/freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I am a little more than halfway through the video but am finding that I'm not understanding how to code the shapes. I think what's throwing me off is the width. It's also late, so I'll be finishing up tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I deviated from the Tetris game to work on a simple calculator, but following a Youtube video where classes were used, I realized that I didn't know enough Javascript to convert the class into a function using prototype's and this. So, that turned into me using Codecademy, which ended in a Rock, Paper, Scissors game project that I am now turning into a cute mini game. 

**Thoughts:** So far, it's looking good. However, when I console log my determineWinner function, I'm finding that my Tied statement is being returned even when the Computer's guess and the User's guess are not equal. According to Codecademy, my code is correct, so I had trouble figure out why that was. However, when I directly added the user's guess, and computer's guess rather than returning it from my getComputerGuess function, it worked as expected. Once I created the final function to pass all functions into a variable, and then passing that into the determineWinnder function, everything worked as expected.

### Day 5: January 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day learning about higher order functions, and playing with arrays. I also tinkered with the calculator project a little, which I should be able to finish once I finish reading up on iterators. 

**Thoughts:** My goal is to code without following along with the video, except where I'm stuck.

### Day 6: January 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first challenge project for Javascript in CodeAcademy. The HTML and CSS, and advanced Javascript, however, belongs to Codeacademy. I just added a couple of functions which were pretty straight forward, and didn't include arrays or iterators, which I studied today. However, once I complete the chapter on Objects, I'll be ready for the next challenge. However, I'll be in San Francisco for the next two days, so I might not be able to complete any coding challenges for those days, we'll see.

**Thoughts**: Pretty simple challenge compared to what I learned today about arrays. In fact, I started overthinking how to tackle some of the functions. I am curious to see what the next challenge, however, will be like, which involves arrays, iterators and objects.

### Day 7: January 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got home from SF, and I'm wiped, but I spent an hour or so working on a couple of Codecademy intermediate code challenges. Not sure they're worth putting on codepen since it's all console log stuff, but it's something.

**Thoughts**: Learned a few more built in JS functions, such as sort and reverse. 

### Day 8: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided to do a simple color flipper challenge with Javascript, purely from scratch and without a walkthrough. Quite simple, but then I decided to challenge myself a bit by adding a filter to either display/generate the colors in RGB or Hex. Got most of the way there, but am having trouble getting the generator to use Hex when that radio button is checked. For some reason, that event never fires. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty sure I spent most of the two hours trying to resolve the Hex radio button to no avail. Now it's midnight, so I will get some sleep and try aggain tomorrow. Mostly there though!

### Day 8: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Resolved the issue with the hex function. Turns out that my radio buttons needed to be called using document.getElementById instead of document.querySelector. Then I followed node.dev/how-to-create-animated-toggle-switches-with-just-css-and-implement-a-dark-mode-feature very helpful tutorial to add a switch that toggles between hex and rgb output. 

**Thoughts**: I see lots of code for pure CSS toggle switches, but I really liked Davey's breakdown of what each line of code is doing, because it wasn't making a lot of sense initially. Now I'm 99% happy with how everything turned out. The only issue is that the switch between rgb and hex code is a little janky - you have to click the button one additional time in order to switch over. I also noticed that after a handful of clicks, the switch between both functions stops working, so - 95%.
