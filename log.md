# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Restarting this as I got off track with the move to a new city. As such, I'm going to do Javascript30's 30 day challenge, starting with the Javascript Drum Kit. I also reused an old portfolio site idea to display my 100 day coding projects, so I spent about an hour or so cleaning it up and adding my new projects.

**Thoughts:** Learned some new concepts, such as data attributes, but I realized that I need to up my knowledge of Javascript before I dive deeper. As such, I'm studying through freeCodeCamp, and will be starting with some more basic HTML/CSS projects then return to the Javascript Drum Kit. My intention is not to copy + paste, but to make it my own.

**Tools Used**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, forEach

### Day 2: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cert to go over basic HTML and CSS, and then started working on the first project, a responsive tribute page to Bessie Coleman. It took a few hours, because once I started, I couldn't quit until the page was done, and I'm proud of it in spite of, or maybe because of, it's simplicity. 

**Thoughts:** There a little CSS nuggets that I did not know previously such as animations, and while I'm sufficient with CSS grid, I have yet to do anything in Flexbox so the 5 projects tied to this "certification" will give me a chance to utilize flexbox, which is how I learn. For the first project, however, the layout is extremely simple, so as recommended, I coded it in codepen, and played around with the parallax scrolling affect.

**Tools Used**: HTML, CSS, responsive design, responsive image, before/after selectors

### Day 3: January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the second project from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cert - the goal to create a responsive web form. So, I created one for Aesop's Zoo, and got all of the tests passing. Tomorrow, I will just clean up the layout a little as I feel the spacing is off somewhat, especially after grouping the checkboxes and radio buttons in fieldsets. 

**Thoughts:** Not too bad. Thought about using flex for the layout, but pretty much stuck to block/inline displays.

### Day 4: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Took the day off yesterday, and today I am going through a JavaScript basics tutorial whilst building a Tetris game via Ania Kubow/freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I am a little more than halfway through the video but am finding that I'm not understanding how to code the shapes. I think what's throwing me off is the width. It's also late, so I'll be finishing up tomorrow.
