# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 19, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Restarting this as I got off track with the move to a new city. As such, I'm going to do Javascript30's 30 day challenge, starting with the Javascript Drum Kit. I also reused an old portfolio site idea to display my 100 day coding projects, so I spent about an hour or so cleaning it up and adding my new projects.

**Thoughts:** Learned some new concepts, such as data attributes, but I realized that I need to up my knowledge of Javascript before I dive deeper. As such, I'm studying through freeCodeCamp, and will be starting with some more basic HTML/CSS projects then return to the Javascript Drum Kit. My intention is not to copy + paste, but to make it my own.

### Day 2: 

**Today's Progress**: Started reviewing freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cert to go over basic HTML and CSS, and then started working on the first project, a responsive tribute page to Bessie Coleman. I got most of the layout done, but I want to add in a decent timeline, so I'll finish working on that tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** There a little CSS nuggets that I did not know previously such as animations, and while I'm sufficient with CSS grid, I have yet to do anything in Flexbox so the 5 projects tied to this "certification" will give me a chance to utilize flexbox, which is how I learn. For the first project, however, the layout is extremely simple, so I build it on codepen, and played around with a parallax scrolling affect.
