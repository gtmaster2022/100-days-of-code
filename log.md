### Day 1: January , 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Frontendmentor.io project. Laid down most of the HTML and CSS, including grid display. Tomorrow, I just need to clean up the layout, and add images.  

**Thoughts:** A pretty simple project, I think. I spent most of my time trying to get the layout just right.  

**Link to work:** [3-column preview card component challenge](http://www.example.com)
