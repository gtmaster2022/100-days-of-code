# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Frontendmentor.io project. Laid down most of the HTML and CSS, including grid display. Tomorrow, I just need to clean up the layout, and add images.  

**Thoughts:** A pretty simple project, I think. I spent most of my time trying to get the layout just right.

### Day 2: January 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my first Frontendmentor.io project. However, didn't pick up a second project on account of work and running a fever. Will publish and continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** SICK DAY.

### Day 3: January 12, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Frontendmentor.io project. Finished pretty quicky, so I took some time to play around with pure CSS images. My first being a [Koala Bear](https://codepen.io/gtmaster2022/pen/Jjrezxw).

**Thoughts:** I was surprised how easily everything came together. Time to start finding more javascript heavy projects.
